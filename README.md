<p><b>node chat room app - using socket io</b></p>

<p>This project is hosted on heroku at <a href="https://intense-wave-25014.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://intense-wave-25014.herokuapp.com/</a> </p>

<p>This chat room app was a great start to working with sockets. To use, enter a display name and a room name. Open a second tab and enter the same room with a different display name. You will be able to send messages within the room (room name specific). Also added in a call to geolocation to send the users current location, because, why not.</p>

<p>Items to still add:</p>
<ul>
<li>make chat rooms case insensitive</li>
<li>reject users with identical names</li>
<li>add list of active rooms to choose from</li>
</ul>
